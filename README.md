# Push_swap

Push_swap is a C program designed to sort a stack of integers using a minimal number of operations. This project challenges developers to implement efficient algorithms while adhering to specific constraints.

## Features

- Implements sorting with two stacks (`a` and `b`) and a predefined set of operations.
- Uses the **Turk Sorting Algorithm** for efficient sorting.
- Outputs the smallest sequence of instructions needed to sort the stack.
- Handles errors such as invalid inputs or duplicate values gracefully.
- Bonus feature: A `checker` program to validate the correctness of the sorting instructions.

## Turk Sorting Algorithm

The **Turk Sorting Algorithm** is a custom, efficient approach tailored for this project, where minimizing operations is critical. The algorithm dynamically handles different numbers of elements using a step-by-step process:

### Logic Behind the Algorithm:

1. **Sorting Small Stacks**:
   - **Sort Two Function**: Used to sort exactly two numbers in stack `a`.
   - **Sort Three Function**: Used to sort exactly three numbers in stack `a`.

2. **Main Sorting Logic**:
   - **Push_swap Function**:
     - Move all elements from stack `a` to stack `b`, leaving only three elements in stack `a`.
     - Sort the remaining three elements in stack `a` using the `Sort Three Function`.
     - Assign a **target position** in stack `a` for each number in stack `b`.
     - Identify the **cheapest number** in stack `b` to move back into the correct position in stack `a`. The "cheapest" number is
       calculated based on the number of operations required.
     - Optimize stack `a` after each move using rotations (`ra` or `rra`) to maintain sorted order.

This structured logic ensures that the program uses the least number of operations possible, making the Turk Sorting Algorithm highly efficient for this type of project.


### Compilation
To compile the program, use the provided Makefile. This will generate the `push_swap` executable.

### Running the Program
Run the program with a list of integers to sort. The output will be a series of operations that sort the stack.

## How to Use
```bash
make
./push_swap {random numbers}
```

### Checker Program
The `checker` program validates the output of `push_swap`. It takes the original stack and the operations generated by `push_swap` as input and confirms whether the stack is sorted correctly.

## How to use the checker
``` bash
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker_Mac $ARG
```

### Error Handling
The program will display `Error` in the following cases:
- Non-integer arguments.
- Duplicate integers.
- Out-of-range values.
- Invalid instructions.
